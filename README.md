## Virtualis

A presentation website for Virtualis: a (fictional) VRChat tour agency created by Matt Romein and Lydia Jessup as part of the International Documentary Film Festival of Amsterdam ([IDFA](https://www.idfa.nl/en/film/934a1588-e0f5-4340-8e1d-540fc65878a3/virtualis?&collectionType=idfa)) 2020.

More information and context can be found in my [portfolio](http://cezar.io/virtualis), or on the [Virtualis](https://virtualis.tours) website.

**Project Context**

* I worked on this project as a part-time developer, during September & October of 2020. The project designer had handed me a series of desktop-only, static, high-fidelity mock-ups.
* The total development time was ~30-40 hours.

**Technical Information**

* The project is built using React and Next.js, and makes use of Paper.js for the dynamic elements on the landing page (bubbles & rotating text frame,) as well as shaders for the animated gradient backgrounds.
* Using a CMS was beyond the scope of this project, but the content is separated from the code in JSON files.
* It uses a small React Context for app-wide state management. There isn't much state :)
