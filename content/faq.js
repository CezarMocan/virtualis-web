      content: [
        "The focus of our tours is twofold. One is to introduce people to the world of VRChat and its norms and communities in a way that makes it feel inviting and accessible for new users of the platform and social VR in general. The second is to start discussions on media theory topics and the future of social VR that manifest in VRChat. Each tour will involve visiting different VRChat worlds and communities with open ended lectures and activities with the goal of fostering a discussion amongst tour participants on these topics.",

      title: 'Why are you doing this?',
      content: [
        "Matt and Lydia have long been fascinated with avatars, social VR, and virtual worlds. They had been researching other virtual worlds such as Second Life, The Sims Online, and M.U.D.S. when they found VRChat and started to have their research meetings on the platform. After interviews with VRChat members they settled on a tourist agency as a fun and playful way to share their research and ideas with a new audience.",
